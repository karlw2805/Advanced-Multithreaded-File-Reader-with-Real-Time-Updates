# Advanced-Multithreaded-File-Reader-with-Real-Time-Updates
This repository is my project for Operating Systems (CSC-204) course. 
- ● Description: Develop a multithreaded file reader that reads large files concurrently and handles
real-time updates to the file.
- ○ Implement read/write locks to handle concurrent access.
- ○ Add a mechanism to detect and handle file modifications in real-time.
- ○ Implement a buffered reading mechanism to reduce I/O overhead.
- ● Deliverables: Source code, performance analysis, and a report on real-time file handling.
